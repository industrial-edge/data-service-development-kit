Data Service modes As of version 1.4, there are two modes for the Data Service: Stand-alone Data Service All functions including user interface available Integrated Data Service in IIH (Industrial Information Hub) The Data Service no longer has its own user interface. Data retention for assets and variables can now be set directly in the IIH. For additional information on the integration in the IIH, click here:  Integrating Data Service into the IIH Connectivity Suite Connectors The Data Service now supports Connectivity Suite connectors in addition to MQTT connectors. System information dashboard In the System Information dashboard, you can view the information from the System Info connector. You can find additional information here:  Display system information Setting aggregation for variables When creating a variable, you can set an aggregation and significantly improve performance in the Data Service by pre-calculating the data. Pre-calculated aggregations are taken into account when querying the data. This decisively shortens the duration of the query. For example, the aggregations API queries the last month with aggregation \"Sum\".  For this, the aggregation is calculated from the raw data as needed (at 1ms cycle = 2 628 000 000 data points). However, if pre-calculated aggregations have been configured on the variable, the aggregation can be calculated from them (e.g. 1h aggregation configured = 730 data points). For additional information on creating an aggregation, click here:  Adding a variable General Performance improvements Anomaly Detection compatibility The Anomaly Detection app (V1.0, V1.1 and future versions) is only compatible with the standalone Data Service. When the Data Service is integrated into the IIH, it is no longer compatible with Anomaly Detection. Only with Data Service V1.5 will Anomaly Detection be compatible in IIH mode.';

The following scenarios are therefor possible: 5,000 variables with a write cycle of 1 s (5,000 * 1,000/1,000 = 5,000 changes) 500 variables with a write cycle of 100 ms (500 * 1,000/100 = 5,000 changes) 50 variables with a write cycle of 10 ms (50 * 1,000/10 = 5,000 changes) etc. If the values are sent from the connector in packets, more data can be processed. For example, a connector sends the values of a variable in packets of 1,000 every second. This means that there is only one write operation per second.

Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more secure. Siemens strongly recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are available and that the latest product versions are used. Use of product versions that are no longer supported, and failure to apply latest updates may increase customer’s exposure to cyber threats.

With the OpenAPI, you can connect your user-developed app to the  Data Service and access the interfaces of the  Data Service. You can find the routes for the  Data Service by clicking the  icon in the title bar under \" API Documentation\". The routes remain stable or compatible for at least 1 year. When a route is changed in such a way that existing interfaces have to be adapted ( breaking change), this is announced in the OpenAPI specification in the description of the route ( deprecated). You have one year to adapt your routes accordingly.  Requirement The OpenAPI of the  Data Service is available in the Industrial Edge Device-wide Docker network \" proxy-redirect\".  To communicate with the OpenAPI from the Data Service, an app must define this \" external\" network with the \" bridge\" driver: Depending on the environment, the  Data Service is available there under this URL: Edge Box: http://edgeappdataservice:4203 Industrial Edge App Publisher You can find additional information on how to integrate your custom-developed app in  Industrial Edge Management here:  Industrial Edge App Publisher Procedure To set up a connection to the OpenAPI of the  Data Service, follow these steps:  You can retrieve information, for example, by calling the \" getTimeSeries\" method.  Additional routes can be found in the OpenAPI specification. Quality of values If the quality is  GOOD or  UNCERTAIN, then the values are taken fully into account in the app. What does it mean if the value has the quality  BAD: This value is not taken into account when calculating KPIs, for example, in  Performance Insight or  Energy Manager. The value is also saved when the raw data is saved in an app. ';
