In order to protect plants, systems, machines and networks against cyber threats, it is necessary to implement - and continuously maintain - a holistic, state-of-the-art industrial security concept. Siemens’ products and solutions constitute one element of such a concept. Customers are responsible for preventing unauthorized access to their plants, systems, machines and networks. Such systems, machines and components should only be connected to an enterprise network or the internet if and to the extent such a connection is necessary and only when appropriate security measures (e.g. firewalls and/or network segmentation) are in place. For additional information on industrial security measures that may be implemented, please visit: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity Siemens’ products and solutions undergo continuous development to make them more secure. Siemens strongly recommends that product updates are applied as soon as they are available and that the latest product versions are used. Use of product versions that are no longer supported, and failure to apply latest updates may increase customer’s exposure to cyber threats.

With Industrial Edge, you use intelligence and scalability of the cloud directly in your manufacturing - in a simple, high-performance manner and without your data leaving the manufacturing process. Industrial Edge combines local and high-performance data processing directly in automation with the advantages of the cloud: app-based data analysis, data processing and Infrastructure-as-a-Service concepts with central update functionality. In this way, you can quickly integrate apps into manufacturing and manage them with a high degree of automation. Industrial Edge gives you the opportunity to continuously make changes to your automation components and plants, analyze large volumes of data in automation to realize innovative functions, such as preventive maintenance, and to obtain maximum flexibility and thus productivity over the entire machine life cycle. With the Industrial Edge Hub, an App Store is available to you where you can find all Siemens apps and 3rd-party apps. From here, you can manage all licenses for your apps and devices centrally and install updates for security issues, device firmware, apps and Industrial Edge Management. You can monitor and manage distributed Edge devices centrally in the Industrial Edge Management. In this way, new apps and software functions, for example, can be installed on all connected Edge devices company-wide. Central software management thus minimizes the workload for performing maintenance and updates on individual devices. On the individual Industrial Edge devices, you can start and run apps and keep statistics on an Edge device, for example. With the Industrial Edge Publisher, you can develop your own Edge apps and make them available to other users in Industrial Edge Management. Another component of the Industrial Edge ecosystem is Industrial Edge Runtime, which is installed on Edge Devices (IED) or Unified Comfort Panels (UCP) and on which the system, including all applications, ultimately runs.';

Definition of an asset An asset is a digital representation of a machine or automation system with one or more automation units (e.g. PLC). The data that describes an asset is collected and transferred. The data is then made available for further processing and evaluation. Definition of an aspect An aspect is a mechanism for data modeling of assets. Aspects group related data points (topics) based on their logical assignment.  Example: A machine has an \"Energy consumption\" aspect that contains the datapoints \"Performance\", \"Power\", \"Voltage\", etc. The aspect is defined in the  Data Service and its name can be freely selected.

The following scenarios are therefor possible: 5,000 variables with a write cycle of 1 s (5,000 * 1,000/1,000 = 5,000 changes) 500 variables with a write cycle of 100 ms (500 * 1,000/100 = 5,000 changes) 50 variables with a write cycle of 10 ms (50 * 1,000/10 = 5,000 changes) etc. If the values are sent from the adapter in packets, more data can be processed. For example, an adapter sends the values of a variable in packets of 1,000 every second. This means that there is only one write operation per second.
