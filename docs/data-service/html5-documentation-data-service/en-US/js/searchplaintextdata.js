The following scenarios are therefor possible: 5,000 variables with a write cycle of 1 s (5,000 * 1,000/1,000 = 5,000 changes) 500 variables with a write cycle of 100 ms (500 * 1,000/100 = 5,000 changes) 50 variables with a write cycle of 10 ms (50 * 1,000/10 = 5,000 changes) etc. If the values are sent from the connector in packets, more data can be processed.

Blob data type is a data type for unstructured data that is stored in binary form. It can be used to store data that is not covered by the other supported data types. In contrast to other data types, the Blob data type has the additional optional property \"Blob type\". This property can be used to define the format of the stored data. We recommend the use of a standardized approach such as MIME types. You can find more information on MIME types here:  MIME types Defining databus credentials centrally The default databus credentials (broker URL, user name, password) can be defined centrally for all connectors in the Data Service settings. However, these settings can be overwritten with connector-specific settings in the respective connector configurations. Adding available connectors SIMATIC connectors and Connectivity Suite connectors can be automatically searched and added with a single click. A manual user-defined connector configuration is not required (but is possible). Exporting/importing variable data The data of a variable can be exported to TXT for a selected time period, including existing aggregations. This export file can be imported to any other variable of your choice.  Possible uses: Initializing a variable with data Backing up/exporting data in a generic format Transferring data to another Data Service instance ... Debugging view In the event of errors, the debugging view provides valuable additional information.  The debugging view can be accessed at \"https://\u003cIED_IP\u003e/dataservice/#/debug\" and shows information, such as component versions and live logs, that is relevant to Support personnel. Extended logging can be enabled on a functional basis to obtain detailed information when needed. V1.4.0 - Migration cleanup With Data Service V1.4.0, several technologies were replaced to achieve better performance.  During installation of V1.4.0 or V1.5.0 based on V1.3.0, automatic migration is performed. This assumes, however, that Data Service still contains the previous technologies.  Starting with V1.6.0, this automatic migration is removed in order to clean up the previous technologies. As a result of this, when a version \u003e= V1.6.0 is installed based directly on a version \u003c= V1.3.0, the configuration and data are not migrated. To retain the data in this update scenario, a data backup must be created before the update and restored after the update.  If your starting point is a version \u003e= 1.4.0, the information above does not apply. Variable and counter configuration in Data Service The variable configuration has been extended to support an acquisition category including counter configuration. This option was previously available only in the Performance Insight app but has now been moved to Data Service to allow these configurations for precalculated aggregations as well. Security: Encrypted / secure configuration memory Sensitive information such as databus credentials is encrypted and secure. Earlier versions of Data Service stored the databus credentials unencrypted in the internal memory. This information was able to be retrieved by downloading the IED file. This has now been corrected. Aggregations: Improvements to the user interface Aggregations are no longer explicitly displayed but are accessible via the source variable. (accessible for retention policy, preview, etc.) Extended error messages and translations in the user interface Error messages for data backup/restoration and the change to IIH mode have been added. Several missing translations have been added. Panel performance optimized The performance of subscriptions on the UCP has been improved.';

Pre-calculated aggregations are taken into account when querying the data. This decisively shortens the duration of the query.

The result is a value that represents the values of the time period for the respective aggregation.

Use the API \"DataService/Calculate\" to calculate single value aggregations. Aggregation of multiple values A single-value aggregation can be calculated multiple times for a specific time period. The aggregation of multiple values is defined by the time period and the aggregations of the individual values (consisting of calculation period and aggregation method). The result is multiple values where each value represents the values in this calculation period for the respective aggregation. Example: \"I want the sum \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated every day \u0027from 2022 to 2023\u0027.\" =\u003e 365 values are returned, where each value represents the summed values of one day. Use the API \"DataService/CalculateTrend\" to calculate aggregations of multiple values. Precalculated aggregations Aggregations can be planned in such a way that they are performed continuously in the background. The other two aggregation types are calculated on request. This aggregation type enables calculation of aggregations on \u0027new-value-written\u0027. That reduces the return time of the request and distributes the resource usage according to the written rate values, which prevents the peaks that occur with the other two aggregation types. A precalculated aggregation is defined using an aggregation and a desired execution cycle. The result is an additional sub-variable that stores the aggregation of each cycle. Example: \"I want the sum \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated \u0027every day\u0027.\" =\u003e A new sub-variable is created in which a new value is stored every day that represents the summed values of the day. Aggregation methods Boolean values are interpreted in calculations as numeric values 0 and 1. Sum Returns the sum of the numeric values for the calculation period. Count Returns the number of values within the calculation period. Average Returns the arithmetic average of numeric values for the calculation period. All values are weighted the same. The result can be a floating-point number. Min Returns the lowest numeric value within the calculation period. Max Returns the highest numeric value within the calculation period. First Returns the first value within the calculation period. Last Returns the last value within the calculation period. Counter Returns the summed value changes of numeric values within the calculation period. With an up counter, only positive value changes are summed. Negative value changes are interpreted as a counter reset. In the case of a down counter, positive and negative value changes are summed. More precise settings can be made at the variable via the counter settings. Timer Returns the time during which a value was not \"false\" (FALSE, NULL or empty string). Time weighted average Returns the time-weighted average of numeric values for the calculation period. The values are weighted differently, depending on how long they have been present. The longer a value was present, the more it is weighted. Standard deviation Returns the standard deviation of numeric values within the calculation period. Variance Returns the variance of numeric values within the calculation period.';
