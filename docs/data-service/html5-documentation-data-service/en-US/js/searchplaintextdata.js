Pre-calculated aggregations are taken into account when querying the data. This decisively shortens the duration of the query. For example, the aggregations API queries the last month with aggregation \"Sum\".  For this, the aggregation is calculated from the raw data as needed (at 1ms cycle = 2 628 000 000 data points). However, if pre-calculated aggregations have been configured on the variable, the aggregation can be calculated from them (e.g. 1h aggregation configured = 730 data points).

The following scenarios are therefor possible: 5,000 variables with a write cycle of 1 s (5,000 * 1,000/1,000 = 5,000 changes) 500 variables with a write cycle of 100 ms (500 * 1,000/100 = 5,000 changes) 50 variables with a write cycle of 10 ms (50 * 1,000/10 = 5,000 changes) etc. If the values are sent from the connector in packets, more data can be processed.

These are identified by keys, e.g. \"Int32\" \"String\", etc. The types of data that are transmitted via the MQTT broker, e.g. from an S7 CPU, are assigned in the Data Service as follows: Data type assignment MQTT data type Data Service data type Bool =\u003e Bool SInt =\u003e Int8 Int =\u003e Int16 DInt =\u003e Int32 LInt =\u003e Int64 USInt =\u003e UInt8 Byte =\u003e UInt8 UInt =\u003e UInt16 Word =\u003e UInt16 UDInt =\u003e UInt32 DWord =\u003e UInt32 ULInt =\u003e UInt64 LWord =\u003e UInt64 Real =\u003e Float LReal =\u003e Double String =\u003e String Char =\u003e String TimeSpan =\u003e Time However, if a connector calls the same data types differently, such as Number instead of Int32 or Text instead of String, these data types are initially unknown to the Data Service. The data types are actually retainable in the DataService, but this is not recognized because the data type is unknown.  For this case, you can select a data type known in the Data Service when adding the variable itself: The hint tells you the data type of the tag. Select the matching data type in the Data Service. If the type is incompatible with the data received, an error is displayed. Changing the data type in the Data Service By default, the data type for a variable is transmitted or assigned via the metadata. You can change the default data type. Make sure that an implicit conversion is possible. Smaller data type can be converted to larger data type. Implicit conversion: It is only possible to implicitly convert the data type from the topic to the Data Service if no data loss occurs. The following data types are available for selection: Bool, Integer (Signed und Unsigned; integers), Float (REAL; floating-point numbers), Double (LREAL; floating-point numbers), String (string), TimeSpan (time period)';
