You will create a user, request a token and get the assets, tags and time series data from the app. You must carry out the following steps beforehand: Build and execute The application example can be launched both locally and via Docker. Follow the steps below to start the application example  via Docker: Open the command line in the folder with the \" package.json\" file and enter the following command: docker-compose up Follow the steps below to start the application example  locally: Open the command line in the folder with the \" package.json\" file and enter the following commands: npm install (The necessary NodeJS modules are downloaded.) npm run build npm run start Execution of the example The application example is configured to run via Docker. For local execution, the Data Service URL (\" .\\client\\dataservice-client.ts\" line 17) must be changed to \" http://localhost:4203\". The app is started in the browser with the local host \" https://localhost:5200\".  Requirement The  Data Service app should be executed and the  Configuration UI should be running; otherwise, an incorrect connection is provided when accessing the routes below. Logical view The logical representation is divided as follows: Feature: The routes are provided here and most of the integration for the token and communication with the client is done in this class. Token manager: With each call, the token is retrieved from the data service. However, it is advisable to store temporarily until the time it expires (30 minutes). The request to re-save from the token should ideally occur after each expiration. Data Service client: This class helps to configure the Data Service URL and establish the connection. The authorization headers for the http request are also managed here. Creating users and token management An app can require a user to access the data service. This user provides a token that can be used to make calls to the Data Service. The lifetime of the token is 30 minutes if the user is available during this lifetime. For user creation and token management please use the feature (/User/create) and the token manager class (getAuthorizationToken()). Assets, tags and time series information The same token mentioned above can be used to perform any operation in the Data Service. The tokens that do not expire are retrieved and added to the request header to retrieve a list of all or each of the required assets and tags. To call up time series information, the \"getTimeSeries\" method is provided in the feature.';

Explanation of terms Docker file: A text file that describes an image with various commands. These are processed during execution and a single layer is created for each command. Image: A memory dump of a container. The image itself consists of several layers that are read-only and thus cannot be modified. Several containers can always be started from one image. Container: The active instance of an image is referred to as container. This means that the container is currently running and is busy. The container is automatically terminated as soon as the container is not running a program or is finished with its job. As a rule, one application runs per container. Repository: A repository is a set of images of the same name with different tags, mostly versions. OpenAPI specification Application example';
