For this purpose,  Data Service subscribes the metadata of the SIMATIC S7 Connector, for example, in order to know the possible tags that the connector provides. After reading the metadata, the  Data Service offers the available tags when creating a variable. The plant structure created in  Data Service is made available with all created variables as a database to other apps.

Use the API \"DataService/Calculate\" to calculate single value aggregations. Series value aggregation A single-value aggregation can be calculated multiple times for a specific time period. The series-value aggregation is defined by the time period and the aggregations of the individual values (consisting of calculation period and aggregation method). The result is a series of multiple values, where each value represents the values in this calculation period for the respective aggregation. Example: \"I want the \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated every day \u0027from 2022 to 2023\u0027.\" =\u003e 365 values are returned, where each value represents the summed values of one day. Use the API \"DataService/CalculateTrend\" to calculate aggregations of a series of multiple values. Precalculated aggregations Aggregations can be planned in such a way that they are performed continuously in the background. The other two aggregation types are calculated on request. This aggregation type enables calculation of aggregations on \u0027new-value-written\u0027. That reduces the return time of the request and distributes the resource usage according to the written rate values, which prevents the peaks that occur with the other two aggregation types. A precalculated aggregation is defined using an aggregation and a desired execution cycle. The result is an additional sub-variable that stores the aggregation of each cycle. Example: \"I want the \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated \u0027every day\u0027.\" =\u003e A new sub-variable is created in which a new value is stored every day that represents the summed values of the day. Aggregation methods Boolean values are interpreted in calculations as numeric values 0 and 1. Sum Returns the sum of the numeric values for the calculation period. Count Returns the number of values within the calculation period. Average Returns the arithmetic average of numeric values for the calculation period. All values are weighted the same. The result can be a floating-point number. Min Returns the lowest numeric value within the calculation period. Max Returns the highest numeric value within the calculation period. First Returns the first value within the calculation period. Last Returns the last value within the calculation period. Counter Returns the summed value changes of numeric values within the calculation period. With an up counter, only positive value changes are summed. Negative value changes are interpreted as a counter reset. In the case of a down counter, positive and negative value changes are summed. More precise settings can be made at the variable via the counter settings. Timer Returns the time during which a value was not \"false\" (FALSE, NULL or empty string). Time weighted average Returns the time-weighted average of numeric values for the calculation period. The values are weighted differently, depending on how long they have been present. The longer a value was present, the more it is weighted. Standard deviation Returns the standard deviation of numeric values within the calculation period. Variance Returns the variance of numeric values within the calculation period.';

You can model the structure of your industrial process using assets and aspects and divide it into logical units, for example, one asset per machine. Defining the retention policy for the variable data By default, all data that is transferred from the connectors to the variables is automatically stored in IIH Essentials for an unlimited amount of time. The retention policy allows you to define the length of time that data is to be stored for each individual asset level and variable.

V1.4.0 - Migration cleanup With IIH Essentials (formerly Data Service) V1.4.0, several technologies were replaced to achieve better performance.  During installation of V1.4.0 or V1.5.0 based on V1.3.0, automatic migration is performed. This assumes, however, that IIH Essentials still contains the previous technologies.  Starting with V1.6.0, this automatic migration is removed in order to clean up the previous technologies. As a result of this, when a version \u003e= V1.6.0 is installed based directly on a version \u003c= V1.3.0, the configuration and data are not migrated. To retain the data in this update scenario, a data backup must be created before the update and restored after the update.  If your starting point is a version \u003e= 1.4.0, the information above does not apply. Variable and counter configuration in IIH Essentials The variable configuration has been extended to support an acquisition category including counter configuration. This option was previously available only in the Performance Insight app but has now been moved to IIH Essentials to allow these configurations for precalculated aggregations as well. Security: Encrypted / secure configuration memory Sensitive information such as databus credentials is encrypted and secure. Earlier versions of IIH Essentials stored the Databus credentials unencrypted in internal memory. This information was able to be retrieved by downloading the IED file. This has now been corrected. Aggregations: Improvements to the user interface Aggregations are no longer explicitly displayed but are accessible via the source variable. (accessible for retention policy, preview, etc.) Extended error messages and translations in the user interface Error messages for data backup/restoration and the change to  Integrated-Mode have been added.

IIH Essentials modes As of version 1.4, there are two modes for IIH Essentials: Standalone IIH Essentials All functions including user interface available Integrated IIH Essentials in IIH (Industrial Information Hub) IIH Essentials no longer has its own user interface. Data retention for assets and variables can now be set directly in the IIH. For additional information on the integration in the IIH, click here:  Integrating IIH Essentials into the Common Configurator Connectivity Suite Connectors IIH Essentials now supports Connectivity Suite connectors in addition to MQTT connectors. System information dashboard In the System Information dashboard, you can view the information from the System Info connector. You can find additional information here:  Display system information Setting aggregation for variables When creating a variable, you can set up an aggregation and significantly improve performance in IIH Essentials by pre-calculating the data. Pre-calculated aggregations are taken into account when querying the data. This decisively shortens the duration of the query. For example, the aggregations API queries the last month with aggregation \"Sum\".  For this, the aggregation is calculated from the raw data as needed (at 1ms cycle = 2 628 000 000 data points). However, if pre-calculated aggregations have been configured on the variable, the aggregation can be calculated from them (e.g. 1h aggregation configured = 730 data points). For additional information on creating an aggregation, click here:  Creating a variable General Performance improvements Anomaly Detection compatibility The Anomaly Detection app (V1.0, V1.1 and future versions) is only compatible with standalone IIH Essentials. If IIH Essentials has been integrated into IIH, it is no longer compatible with Anomaly Detection. Only with IIH Essentials V1.5 (formerly Data Service) will Anomaly Detection be compatible in IIH mode.';

The following special features and restrictions apply when Insights Hub is used as the data destination for data synchronization. Data prioritization Live data is synchronized directly with Insights Hub. If synchronization has not been completed, for example due to a connection error, historical data is synchronized with Insights Hub at the next connection. In this case, historical and live data is synchronized with Insights Hub in parallel. Live data have a higher priority. Loss of data If a synchronized variable is moved in IIH Essentials, the data of this variable is lost in Insights Hub. This also applies to the addition or removal of a variable to/from an aspect. To synchronize data again, modify the start date. Limitations The following restrictions apply for the data upload: A maximum of 100 queries per second Maximum size of the net data: 128 kb per request Maximum of 500 packets per request Supported regions Solely the region EU1 is currently supported. Unidirectional synchronization Data is always synchronized in one direction – from IIH Essentials to Insights Hub. Synchronization in the other direction – from Insights Hub to IIH Essentials – does not take place. Requirements Insights Hub can be accessed via the network.
