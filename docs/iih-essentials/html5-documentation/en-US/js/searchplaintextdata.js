Aggregation types Single value aggregations A variable is aggregated by specifying the aggregation method and the calculation period. The result is a value that represents the values of the time period for the respective aggregation. Calculation period: from[to], from exclusive, to inclusive Example: \"I want the sum \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 from \u00272022 to 2023\u0027 to be calculated.\" =\u003e one value is returned that represents the summed values of the year. Use the API \"DataService/Calculate\" to calculate single value aggregations. Series value aggregation A single-value aggregation can be calculated multiple times for a specific time period. The series-value aggregation is defined by the time period and the aggregations of the individual values (consisting of calculation period and aggregation method). The result is a series of multiple values, where each value represents the values in this calculation period for the respective aggregation. Example: \"I want the \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated every day \u0027from 2022 to 2023\u0027.\" =\u003e 365 values are returned, where each value represents the summed values of one day. Use the API \"DataService/CalculateTrend\" to calculate aggregations of a series of multiple values. Precalculated aggregations Aggregations can be planned in such a way that they are performed continuously in the background. The other two aggregation types are calculated on request. This aggregation type enables calculation of aggregations on \u0027new-value-written\u0027. That reduces the return time of the request and distributes the resource usage according to the written rate values, which prevents the peaks that occur with the other two aggregation types. A precalculated aggregation is defined using an aggregation and a desired execution cycle. The result is an additional sub-variable that stores the aggregation of each cycle. Example: \"I want the \u0027sum\u0027 of \u0027Variable X\u0027 to be calculated \u0027every day\u0027.\" =\u003e A new sub-variable is created in which a new value is stored every day that represents the summed values of the day. Aggregation methods Boolean values are interpreted in calculations as numeric values 0 and 1. Sum Returns the sum of the numeric values for the calculation period. Count Returns the number of values within the calculation period. Average Returns the arithmetic average of numeric values for the calculation period. All values are weighted the same. The result can be a floating-point number. Min Returns the lowest numeric value within the calculation period. Max Returns the highest numeric value within the calculation period. First Returns the first value within the calculation period. Last Returns the last value within the calculation period. Counter Returns the summed value changes of numeric values within the calculation period. With an up counter, only positive value changes are summed. Negative value changes are interpreted as a counter reset. In the case of a down counter, positive and negative value changes are summed. More precise settings can be made at the variable via the counter settings. Timer Returns the time during which a value was not \"false\" (FALSE, NULL or empty string). Time weighted average Returns the time-weighted average of numeric values for the calculation period. The values are weighted differently, depending on how long they have been present. The longer a value was present, the more it is weighted. Standard deviation Returns the standard deviation of numeric values within the calculation period. Variance Returns the variance of numeric values within the calculation period. EnergyToPower A consumption value is converted to power. This aggregation function can only be selected in combination with the Consumption Value (Energy) and Counter acquisition categories. PowerToEnergy Power is converted to a consumption value. This aggregation function can only be selected in combination with the Power acquisition category. AmountToFlow An amount value (per hour) is directly converted to a flow value. This aggregation function can only be selected in combination with the Amount and Counter acquisition categories. FlowToAmount A flow value (amount/h) is converted to am amount value. The function calculates an estimated value for the upcoming period based on the current flow value. This aggregation function can only be selected in combination with the Flow acquisition category.';

System information dashboard In the System Information dashboard, you can view the information from the System Info connector. You can find additional information here:  Display system information Setting aggregation for variables When creating a variable, you can set up an aggregation and significantly improve performance in IIH Essentials by pre-calculating the data. Pre-calculated aggregations are taken into account when querying the data. This decisively shortens the duration of the query. For example, the aggregations API queries the last month with aggregation \"Sum\".  For this, the aggregation is calculated from the raw data as needed (at 1ms cycle = 2 628 000 000 data points). However, if pre-calculated aggregations have been configured on the variable, the aggregation can be calculated from them (e.g. 1h aggregation configured = 730 data points). For additional information on creating an aggregation, click here:  Creating a variable General Performance improvements Anomaly Detection compatibility The Anomaly Detection app (V1.0, V1.1 and future versions) is only compatible with standalone IIH Essentials.

Multiplication of all positive numbers less than or equal to Factorial Number The following binary operators are supported (from the highest to the lowest priority): Operator Description Notes * / % Multiplication Division Modulo Mathematical operators + - Addition Subtraction \u003c  \u003e  \u003c= \u003e= Relational operators Relational operators have a higher priority than equality operators, in contrast to IEC 6113-1. == != Equality operators Equality operators have a lower priority than relational operators, in contrast to IEC 6113-1. ^ Bit-wise Exclusive Or of the C languages AND logical AND OR logical OR The following ternary operators are supported: Operator Description Notes ? : Conditional operator The priority of the ternary operators is lower than that of all other operators. All listed operators can be combined with any process tags and constants (as long as the data types fit). The sequence of the operations can be changed by using brackets: In the expression (x+y)*z the sub-expression x+y is calculated first and then the result is multiplied by z. For Boolean values, the text representations true and false or the numerical values 0 and 1 can be used. A numerical calculation with a result of the data type BOOL must be evaluated either as 0 or 1. Any other value leads to an evaluation error. Conditional evaluations can be made with the ternary operator. The general syntax is \u003ccondition\u003e ? \u003ctrue case\u003e : \u003cfalse case\u003e :  if the result of the sub-expression \u003ccondition\u003e is TRUE (or unequal to 0), then the result is the value of the sub-expression \u003ctrue case\u003e. Otherwise the result is the value of \u003cfalse case\u003e. Examples for transformation rules a \u003e b ? x + 1 : 0 If the actual value of the variables a is greater than the actual value of the variables b, the value of the assigned variables is set to the result of the evaluation of  x+1. Otherwise if a is smaller or equal to b, the value of the assigned variables is set to 0. a \u003e b ? 1 : x + y If the actual value of the variables a is greater than the actual value of the variables b, the value of the assigned variables is set to 1. Otherwise the value of the assigned variables is set to the result of the evaluation of x+y. (a \u003e b ? 1 : x) + y If the actual value of the variables a is greater than the actual value of the variables b, the value of the assigned variables is set to 1+y. Otherwise the value of the assigned variables is set to the result of the evaluation of x+y. Procedure To transform an assigned tag in the asset model, follow these steps: Open the variable settings or create a new variable. Click \"Transformation\" in the \"Source\" tab. Create the transformation rule in the rule editor. Click \" Add Variable\" to check and save the syntax of the transformation rule, operands and operators. The tag must be placed in double quotation marks. Click \" Validate\" to validate the syntax of the transformation rule, the operands and operators immediately. The tag must be enclosed in single quotes. Click \" Save\". Result As soon as the transformation rule has been created, the variable is displayed in the list.';

V1.4.0 - Migration cleanup With IIH Essentials (formerly Data Service) V1.4.0, several technologies were replaced to achieve better performance.  During installation of V1.4.0 or V1.5.0 based on V1.3.0, automatic migration is performed. This assumes, however, that IIH Essentials still contains the previous technologies.  Starting with V1.6.0, this automatic migration is removed in order to clean up the previous technologies. As a result of this, when a version \u003e= V1.6.0 is installed based directly on a version \u003c= V1.3.0, the configuration and data are not migrated. To retain the data in this update scenario, a data backup must be created before the update and restored after the update.  If your starting point is a version \u003e= 1.4.0, the information above does not apply.

This option was previously available only in the Performance Insight app but has now been moved to IIH Essentials to allow these configurations for precalculated aggregations as well. Security: Encrypted / secure configuration memory Sensitive information such as databus credentials is encrypted and secure. Earlier versions of IIH Essentials stored the Databus credentials unencrypted in internal memory. This information was able to be retrieved by downloading the IED file. This has now been corrected.

For this purpose,  IIH Essentials subscribes the metadata, for example, of the SIMATIC S7 Connector in order to know the possible tags that the connector provides. After reading the metadata,  IIH Essentials offers the available tags when creating a variable. The plant structure (My Plant) created in  IIH Essentials is made available with all created variables as a database to other apps. Depending on which connector you are using, the data is transferred either via the  Databus to  IIH Essentials or directly via the Connectivity Suite: Databus settings Because the connectors often use the same  Databus channel, you can define the Databus settings centrally in one place. If a connector deviates from this default setting, you can change the settings individually at the connector. Connectivity Suite Connectivity Suite connectors transfer their data directly to  IIH Essentials via gRPC. The following connectors are available by default: Connector Documentation in Siemens Industry Online Support Ethernet IP Connector   Ethernet IP Connector HMIRuntime adapter (Unified Comfort Panel) Modbus TCP Connector   Modbus TCP Connector OPC UA Connector PROFINET IO Connector   PROFINET IO Connector SIMATIC S7 Connector   SIMATIC S7 Connector SIMATIC S7+ Connector   SIMATIC S7+ Connector Simulation Connector SLMP Connector   SLMP Connector System Info Connector The System Info connector can be used to store metrics (such as CPU load, RAM load, etc.) in  IIH Essentials in order to monitor it and to have more data available for troubleshooting in the event of an error. You can view the metrics visualization in the system information dashboard:  Display system information UnifiedonEdge Variables of the System Info connector The  System Info connector offers the following variables: Name Description CPU statistics CPUUsage The current CPU usage in %. The value range is from 0 to 100. Heap statistics (RAM usage) TotalHeapSize The RAM (in MB) that is currently reserved by the app. UsedHeapSize The RAM (in MB) currently used by the app. FreeHeapSize The RAM that is currently available (not reserved by any app). App status - Database DatabaseSize The currently reserved size (in MB) for the database. Status and connection of the connectors You can see from the icons whether a connector is connected or not: Symbol Meaning The connector is connected to the  Databus or the topic. This means metadata has been received via the metadata topic. The connector has no connection. The connector is connected (status = active), but no metadata is received via the metadata topic. Adding self-developed connectors You can use the icon  to add connectors you have developed yourself. User name and password The user name and password must be configured in the MQTT Broker, or in the Databus, and then entered in the connector. MQTT connector The Ethernet IP connector, Modbus TCP connector, Profinet IO connector, SIMATIC S7 connector and System Info connectors use the \" Message Queue Telemetry Transport\" (MQTT) protocol. The connection to the MQTT broker must be configured in the Industrial Edge Databus:  Databus More general information about the MQTT protocol can be found here:  MQTT.org HMTIRuntime connector (Open Pipe Path) SIMATIC HMI WinCC Unified Open Pipe is an openness concept based on pipe technology for connecting the  IIH Essentials  to  WinCC Unified RT. Compared to Openness RT (ODK),  SIMATIC HMI WinCC Unified Open Pipe provides a limited amount of functionality. As a result, the connection code can be written in any programming language that supports pipe technology. Even batch access to the pipe is possible.

Various connectors (such as the S7 connector in Industrial Edge or Open Pipe in the Unified Comfort Panel) can serve as the plant bus. IIH Essentials is a centrally usable element for structuring and storing data, which can be used by other Edge applications via the API interface so that they do not have to implement their own data management. Functions such as aggregations, data management and structuring are available.

The following special features and restrictions apply when Insights Hub is used as the data destination for data synchronization. Data prioritization IIH Essentials handles historical data and live data differently. Live data: IIH Essentials subscribes to the connectors. When new data arrives, it is sent directly to Insights Hub. This means that live data appears immediately in Insights Hub. Historical data: If the Insights Hub synchronization has to resynchronize historical time ranges due to a disconnection, this is carried out in parallel but with lower priority. Depending on how long the downtime was, this can involve a lot of data and take some time. Even if new live data is already available in Insights Hub after a connection is lost, the process of synchronizing the buffered data can still continue. In addition, Insights Hub handles new data with higher priority than data from the past, which can amplify the effect. Loss of data If a synchronized variable is moved in IIH Essentials, the data of this variable is lost in Insights Hub. This also applies to the addition or removal of a variable to/from an aspect. To synchronize data again, modify the start date. Payload Limits per tenant and per client are specified by Insights Hub and AWS: A maximum of 100 requests per second Maximum 128 kB payload per request Maximum of 500 samples per request The theoretical maximum speed is 100 r/s x 128 kb/r = 12.5 mb/s. However, this could be slower if the maximum number of samples is reached before the high limit for the payload. Supported regions Solely the region EU1 is currently supported.

Synchronization in the other direction – from Insights Hub to IIH Essentials – does not take place. Requirements Insights Hub can be accessed via the network.

Create a request for a user with the \"Admin3rdPartyTechUser\" permissions. You receive the credentials in an encrypted email. Use the credentials you received instead of your regular credentials. The app ID and password (secret key) are the app credentials required when an app such as IIH Essentials requires interaction with REST APIs of Insights Hub. To obtain the certificate login information, open a  Support Ticket . Certificates: Upload the created device certificate, e.g. test-cert.pem.
